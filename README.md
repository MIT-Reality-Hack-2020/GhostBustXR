# ProjectGhost

GhostBustXR is an asymmetrical multiplayer social XR game that creates friendly competition between one human and 3 ghosts. The trick is they are all controlled in real time by people either on their phones or on their headset. It’s fun spooky!

- VR/ MR players are player avatars
- AR players are ghost avatars
- Spectator avatars

## Acknowledgments

* Inspiration

1. Mario Party / Mario Kart
- Mario Party & Mario Kart encourage healthy competition among friends. The games are known for bringing people together and allowing people to get to know each other in a completely non-realistic and non-threatening environment. 

2. Beat Saber
- This game was more of a negative influence on our game. It is because of games like Beat Saber, where inherently one person is immersed playing a game while others look on an spectate for hours, we wanted to create a game exactly the opposite of that- a game where everyone is immersed and able to play a game together.

3. Pac Man
- We borrowed the concept of the many ghosts vs one other player dynamic from this game. 

4. Ghostbusters
- This title was a large part of our game’s namesake. 

5. Jackbox.tv Drawful 2
- Jackbox.tv Drawful 2 multi-user party app demo

6. Acron: Attack of the Squirrels!
- Available for Oculus Quest, Rift, HTC Vive & Mobile
